# Chapter 1: Clean Code

## There Will be Code

* **End of Code Myth:** Some suggest the end of code, envisioning a future where all code is generated from specifications, making programmers obsolete.

* **Code Represents Details:** Code is indispensable as it captures the intricate details of requirements. Specifications at a level machines can execute are essentially code.

* **Increasing Abstraction:** While the abstraction level of programming languages will likely rise, complete elimination of code is unrealistic.

* **Analogy with Mathematics:** Comparing those expecting code extinction to mathematicians hoping for a non-formal mathematics, both notions are impractical.

* **Human Complexity:** Even with intuition and creativity, humans struggle to create successful systems from vague customer feelings. Well-specified requirements are as formal as code.

* **Requirements and Code Connection:** Requirements are the essence expressed in the language of code. Despite advancements in languages and tools, precision remains crucial, ensuring the perpetual existence of code.

## Bad Code

- Kent Beck's book Implementation Patterns is based on the premise that good code matters.
- Good code is a robust, supported, and crucial aspect of our craft, evident through the challenges posed by its absence.
- Bad code often impedes programmers, a phenomenon known as "wading." It involves navigating through tangled, senseless code, hindering progress and understanding.
- The experience of dealing with bad code is common among programmers, raising the question: why write bad code?
- Factors such as the need for speed, time constraints, and external pressures often lead to the creation of messy code.
- The relief of achieving a working mess over nothing, coupled with the intention to clean up later, is a common scenario.
- However, the reality, expressed by LeBlanc's law, is that "later equals never," emphasizing the importance of addressing code quality promptly.
