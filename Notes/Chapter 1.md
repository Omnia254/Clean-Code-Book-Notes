# Chapter 1: Clean Code

## There Will be Code

End of Code Myth: Some suggest the end of code, envisioning a future where all code is generated from specifications, making programmers obsolete.

* **Code Represents Details:** Code is indispensable as it captures the intricate details of requirements. Specifications at a level machines can execute are essentially code.

* **Increasing Abstraction:** While the abstraction level of programming languages will likely rise, complete elimination of code is unrealistic.

* **Analogy with Mathematics:** Comparing those expecting code extinction to mathematicians hoping for a non-formal mathematics, both notions are impractical.

* **Human Complexity:** Even with intuition and creativity, humans struggle to create successful systems from vague customer feelings. Well-specified requirements are as formal as code.

* **Requirements and Code Connection:** Requirements are the essence expressed in the language of code. Despite advancements in languages and tools, precision remains crucial, ensuring the perpetual existence of code.
